  "abstract": "This certificate documents the partial structural correspondence between Kayser's Primordial Leaf diagram and QA proof tree structures. Unlike C1-C4, this correspondence is WEAKER - some aspects map well (ratio overlap, self-similarity), while others do not (envelope geometry). The certificate honestly records both the successes and limitations.",
