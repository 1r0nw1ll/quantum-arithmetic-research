Subject: Rule 30 Follow-Up: Spatial Obstruction Certificate (Cone-Dependency)

Dear Wolfram Research Team,

This is a follow-up to my previous submission regarding Rule 30 center column bounded non-periodicity (periods p ∈ [1, 1024], time horizon T = 16384).

That submission provided **temporal obstruction certificates** — explicit witnesses showing no periodic behavior exists within the tested regime.

I am writing to propose a **complementary spatial obstruction certificate** using a different methodology that addresses a distinct aspect of computational irreducibility.

## Proposed Second Certificate: Cone-Dependency Witness

**Claim Scope (Bounded):**

For Rule 30 center column evolution under single-1 initial condition, I propose to demonstrate that:

For selected time indices t ∈ {64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192}, the value center(t) provably depends on information from the boundary of the light cone.

Specifically, for each t, I will provide explicit demonstration that flipping any initial-condition cell at position ±t (the cone boundary) changes center(t).

**What This Shows:**

- **No local shortcuts:** center(t) cannot be computed from a radius < t
- **Maximal cone dependency:** Full light cone participation required
- **Distinct from periodicity:** Spatial complexity orthogonal to temporal structure

**What This Does NOT Claim:**

- Universal computation properties
- Asymptotic behavior beyond tested time indices
- General irreducibility (still bounded to specified t values)

## Methodology: Perturbation Witness

For each time t:

1. Compute center(t) under standard initial condition (single 1 at position 0)
2. For each boundary position b ∈ {-t, +t}:
   - Flip initial condition at position b
   - Re-evolve to time t
   - Record whether center(t) changed
3. Certificate succeeds if center(t) changes for at least one boundary flip

**Witness Format:**

```json
{
  "time": t,
  "center_baseline": 0 or 1,
  "boundary_position": b,
  "center_perturbed": 0 or 1,
  "dependency_confirmed": true
}
```

**Computational Cost:** O(t) per time index, tractable for t ≤ 8192

## Relation to Previous Submission

These two certificates form a **two-axis obstruction profile**:

| Axis | Certificate Type | Status |
|------|------------------|--------|
| **Temporal** | Bounded cycle impossibility | ✅ Submitted |
| **Spatial** | Cone-dependency witness | 🔜 Proposed |

Both provide **explicit, verifiable evidence** aligned with the computational irreducibility conjecture, but neither claims global or infinite properties.

## Timeline and Deliverables

If this approach is of interest, I can generate:

1. Complete cone-dependency witness data for t ∈ {64, 128, ..., 8192}
2. Formal proof document with conservative bounded claims
3. Machine-readable certificate JSON
4. Source code for independent verification
5. SHA256 hashes for all witness files

**Estimated completion:** 1-2 weeks from approval

## Rationale for Follow-Up Submission

I am proposing this as a **separate certificate** rather than extending the first submission because:

- **Different methodology:** Perturbation analysis vs. sequence enumeration
- **Orthogonal claim:** Spatial dependency vs. temporal non-periodicity
- **Independent verification:** Each stands alone
- **Modular approach:** Additional axes can be added incrementally

This aligns with the strategy of providing **explicit, bounded, verifiable evidence** rather than attempting global proofs.

## Question for Wolfram Research

Before proceeding with full computation, I would appreciate guidance on:

1. **Is this orthogonal approach of interest** for the Rule 30 prize?
2. **Should I target specific time indices** or a different range?
3. **Would you prefer** this integrated with the first submission or kept separate?

I remain committed to conservative, explicitly bounded claims with full reproducibility.

Thank you for considering this follow-up proposal.

**Note:** This follow-up is entirely optional. The original submission stands independently and makes no reference to cone-dependency analysis. This is simply a natural extension using the same witness-based methodology.
