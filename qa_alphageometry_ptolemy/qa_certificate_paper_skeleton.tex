\title{Failure-Aware Reachability Certificates for QA: \\ Unified Proof and Projection Artifacts}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We introduce a \emph{proof certificate} schema for Quantum Arithmetic (QA) that treats both
successful derivations and certified obstructions as first-class mathematical objects.
Unlike standard proof traces which only show success, our certificates always emit a
reviewable obstruction witness when search fails (e.g., depth exhaustion, invariant violation,
component disconnection).
We further extend the same certificate machinery to projection-dependent physics
experiments, where classical laws emerge only under specific observers.
All claims are packaged as deterministic JSON artifacts.
\end{abstract}

\section{Motivation}
Two failures repeatedly block reproducible claims in symbolic / geometric proof search:
(i) successes are traceable, but failures are not, and (ii) ``physics-like'' behavior in QA
is often asserted without a falsifiable projection contract.
We address both by standardizing \emph{certificates}.

\section{Certificate Objects}
Define a certificate as a tuple:
\[
\mathcal{C} = (\texttt{generator\_set}, \texttt{contracts}, \texttt{witness\_type}, \texttt{witness})
\]
where all reachability statements are relative to a generator universe.

\subsection{Generators and Namespaces}
QA substrate generators use the canonical set $\{\sigma,\lambda,\mu,\nu\}$ (and optional inverses).
External engines are namespaced:
\[
\texttt{AG:rule\_id},\quad \texttt{PHYS:probe}.
\]

\subsection{Invariants and Non-Reduction}
Certificates optionally track a list of invariants that must be preserved.
QA's Non-Reduction Axiom is represented as a contract flag; violations are certified
as \texttt{NON\_REDUCTION\_VIOLATION}.

\subsection{Failure Taxonomy}
We treat failure modes as a finite algebra of obstructions (not bugs), including:
\texttt{DEPTH\_EXHAUSTED}, \texttt{GENERATOR\_INSUFFICIENT}, \texttt{SCC\_UNREACHABLE}, etc.

\section{QA-AlphaGeometry Integration}
We define an adapter from AlphaGeometry's beam-search \texttt{SearchResult} to certificates.
A solved result yields a legal step trace \texttt{success\_path}.
An unsolved result yields an \texttt{obstruction} certificate (conservatively \texttt{DEPTH\_EXHAUSTED})
with frontier hash and search metadata.

\paragraph{Artifacts.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{ptolemy\_success.cert.json}
  \item \texttt{ptolemy\_ablated.obstruction.cert.json}
\end{itemize}

\section{Physics as Projection}
We add an explicit \texttt{ProjectionContract} recording:
observer id, time projection, topology/symmetry preservation, and projected observables.
A classical law is then stated as: \emph{the law holds under observer $O$}.

\paragraph{Artifacts.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{reflection\_GeometryAngleObserver.success.cert.json}
  \item \texttt{reflection\_NullObserver.obstruction.cert.json}
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
Certificates shift evaluation from narrative claims to artifact inspection:
success witnesses are checkable, and failures become reviewable mathematical statements.
The same mechanism unifies formal proof, reachability, and projection-dependent physical laws.

\section{Conclusion}
QA can support a certificate-first scientific workflow:
every claim ships as deterministic JSON, with a canonical schema and adapters
for multiple domains.
