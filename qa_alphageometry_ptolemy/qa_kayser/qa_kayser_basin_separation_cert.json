  "abstract": "This certificate documents the rigorous testing and rejection of the C4 conic-basin hypothesis, and establishes the actual mechanism of QA orbit separation: the mod-3 fixed point isolation theorem. Basin boundaries in digital root space are LINEAR (not conic), determined entirely by mod-3 divisibility. This finding upgrades C4 from STRUCTURAL_ANALOGY to PROVEN via HYPOTHESIS_REJECTION + ALTERNATIVE_PROOF.",
