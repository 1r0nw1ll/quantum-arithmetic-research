# Wolfram Rule 30 Prize: Official Rules and Submission Criteria

This document summarizes the official rules and submission criteria for the Wolfram Rule 30 prize, based on information from the official prize website and other reliable sources.

## The Three Problems

The prize is offered for solutions to three fundamental problems concerning the Rule 30 cellular automaton:

1.  **Periodicity of the Center Column:** Does the center column of the Rule 30 pattern always remain non-periodic?
2.  **Black and White Cell Frequency:** Do black and white cells occur on average equally often in the Rule 30 pattern?
3.  **Computational Effort:** Does computing the nth cell of Rule 30 require at least O(n) computational effort?
