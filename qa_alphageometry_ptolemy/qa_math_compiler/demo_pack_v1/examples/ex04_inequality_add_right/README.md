# ex04_inequality_add_right

This example shows a basic Nat inequality in replay-first form.
Open `claim.txt` first for the human statement and Lean target.
Then inspect `task.json` and `trace.json` to see the lemma-driven proof shape.
`replay.json` contains one deterministic replay row for the trace.
`pair.json` binds the claim to the exact formal goal and replay status.
