% Moons: Logistic Regression accuracy vs train size
\newcommand{\capMoonsLogReg}{
  Logistic Regression on two moons. QA per-feature mapping increases linear separability: test accuracy improves across all train sizes compared to raw features.
}

% Moons: SGD(logistic) accuracy vs epoch
\newcommand{\capMoonsMLP}{
  SGD(logistic) on two moons. QA features reach target accuracy in fewer epochs; combining raw+QA typically dominates both individually.
}

% Swiss roll: PCA raw
\newcommand{\capSwissRaw}{
  Swiss roll (raw PCA). The nonlinear manifold remains curved in the first two principal components.
}

% Swiss roll: PCA QA
\newcommand{\capSwissQA}{
  Swiss roll (QA PCA). QA features yield a straighter embedding, improving clusterability and downstream separability.
}

% Tabular: SGD(logistic) accuracy vs epoch
\newcommand{\capTabularSGD}{
  Synthetic tabular classification (20 features). QA and raw+QA reduce epochs-to-accuracy compared to raw under identical optimization and model capacity.
