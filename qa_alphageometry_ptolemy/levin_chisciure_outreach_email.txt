Subject: QA as a certificate-backed completion layer for Diverse Intelligence

Dear Dr. Levin and Dr. Chis-Ciure,

I'm writing to share a technical follow-on that was directly motivated by
your paper "Intelligence Beyond Neurons" (Biological Journal of the Linnean
Society, blae076, 2024).

Your deflationary, scale-free framing of cognition strongly resonated with
my work on Quantum Arithmetic (QA) -- a modular arithmetic framework with
applications in signal processing, optimization, and automated theorem
generation. Rather than proposing an alternative theory of mind, I've been
exploring QA as a *completion layer*: turning problem-space definitions of
intelligence into certificate-backed, reproducible measurements.

Concretely, we formalize cognition as search efficiency in a declared
problem space P = <S, O, C, E, H>, with a substrate-neutral metric

    K = log_10(tau_blind / tau_agent)

and introduce validator contracts that classify successes and structured
failures (constraint editing, goal decoupling, horizon limits, etc.)
across biological and synthetic systems.

The runnable artifact set includes:

  - A "Beyond Neurons" certificate module with three worked exemplars:
    planaria regeneration (K=9, constraint editing),
    cancer as goal decoupling (K=4, evaluation misalignment),
    and non-neural AI intelligence (K=17, substrate neutrality confirmed).

  - A conjecture ledger with explicit, deterministic validator contracts
    (substrate invariance, horizon hierarchy, goal-collapse equivalence).

  - A meta-validator enforcing failure-complete classification across all
    certificate types: every validation produces either success or a
    structured failure record {fail_type, invariant_diff, barrier}.

The entry point is TRIAD_INDEX.md (now a tetrad), and the Beyond Neurons
direction maps directly onto your problem-space formalism. The self-tests
can be run with:

    python qa_meta_validator.py
    python qa_conjecture_core.py

This is offered in the spirit of completion, not competition -- you define
*what* cognition is; QA proposes *how to measure, validate, and falsify
claims* about it. I'd value any critique on whether certificate-backed
measurement usefully sharpens the operational program you outline, or
where it misses the mark.

With thanks for the paper and the broader research direction,

Will
