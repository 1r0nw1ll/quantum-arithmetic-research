Subject: Bounded Non-Periodicity Certificate for Rule 30 Center Column

Dear Wolfram Research Prize Committee,

I am submitting a bounded non-periodicity result for the Rule 30 Elementary Cellular Automaton center column, with explicit counterexamples for all periods p ∈ [1, 1024] within time horizon T = 16384.

CLAIM SCOPE:

This submission provides a bounded certificate with explicit witnesses. I do NOT claim:
- Unbounded or infinite non-periodicity
- Asymptotic behavior beyond the stated parameters
- Computational irreducibility
- Any topological or complexity-theoretic properties

WHAT IS PROVEN:

For each period p in [1, 1024], there exists a concrete time index t ∈ [0, 16384-p] such that center(t) ≠ center(t+p), where center(t) denotes the value at position 0 at time t.

VERIFICATION:

All results are deterministically reproducible from:
- Rule 30 truth table (standard ECA definition)
- Initial condition: single 1 at position 0
- Finite window evolution with light-cone correctness guarantee

Complete witness data is provided with SHA256 hashes:
- CSV witness table: 47c99fcc3edc45ac28ef3b15a296572a3e07a79c16c905fc1217d33783aef95b
- JSON structured data: 572de7f23251f93bff6634b53f39fd1d795629ef3bef6bd17a4f60c6b9e54c21

2. rule30_certificate.json - Machine-readable certificate with parameters
3. witness_rule30_center_P1024_T16384.csv - Explicit counterexamples (1024 entries)

5. center_rule30_T16384.txt - Complete center column sequence
6. computation_summary.txt - Verification summary with hashes
7. rule30_witness_generator.py - Complete implementation

VERIFICATION NOTES:

Each witness (p, t, center_t, center_t_plus_p) satisfies:
- t + p ≤ 16384 (within bounds)
- center_t ≠ center_t_plus_p (explicit inequality)
- Values are deterministic from Rule 30 evolution

Total verified periods: 1024/1024
Failures: 0

REPRODUCIBILITY:

Any verifier can independently check this result by:
1. Implementing Rule 30 with the standard truth table
2. Evolving from single-1 initial condition
3. Extracting center(t) for t = 0..16384
4. Verifying each witness inequality

RELATION TO PRIZE:

This bounded result provides structural evidence aligned with the Rule 30 non-periodicity conjecture, but makes no claims beyond the explicitly stated parameters. The method is extensible to larger time horizons and period ranges if desired.

I understand this is a bounded certificate rather than an unbounded proof. I am submitting it as formal obstruction evidence within a well-defined finite regime.

All artifacts are attached. Please let me know if you need any clarification or additional verification.

Sincerely,
Will Dale
